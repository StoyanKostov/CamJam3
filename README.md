# CamJam3 - NodeJS project
CamJam EduKit #3 is focused on robotics and contains (almost) everything you need to create your very own Raspberry Pi-powered robot.

## Recommendations
1. Raspberry Pi 3 must be set in raspi-config to log with PI user by default
2. The project can be started from /home/pi/.profile with full paths to nodejs and project entry point (At least I couldn't find another way of starting headless raspberry Pi and control the robot by BT keyboard ).
